## Session Overview 

## Learning Objectives

## Outline

1. Data Science is hot now
    1. DJB Data Science Definition: Science + Too Much Data = Data Science 
    2. SysMus people have the sciene part (the hard part to learn, stats, design, thinking, communicating (sometimes))
    3. SysMus peopl need to learn the infrastructure to deal with that much data, and quickly 
2. The Science Part
    1. The problems you run into in research in PhD show you the hard part 
    2. More important to learn how to be able to talk about what you are doing 
    3. Doing a PhD (or MSc) makes you _VERY_ qualified to talk about research 
    4. Better to spend time using your research skills to understand new workplace 
3. The Data for Now Part
   1. Data science is about manipulating a lot of data quickly
   2. Luckily tools of Open Science overlap with data science 
   3. Programming langauge like R or Python (can't ask for 2K license for spss or stata) 
   4. Which one? Whichever serves your purposes in PhD now and can learn easier (for me R, now learning Python) 
   5. Doesn't matter in some ways because other big sell of PhD is tell people you learn quickly 
   6. Once you know one, learn CS ideas and can switch over 
   7. Invest in R or Python while have time, resources, around super smart people (all people on call now) 
   8. Use it to do better science, stats, make reproducible reserach (read introduction to SL) 
   9. Also make pretty graphs if you can 
4. The data for later part 
   1. There are many more tools that exist to make working with Python/R easier
   2. Git: can learn if want, for developing software and collaboration, also can show off code with github
   3. RDBMS: World of tables and joins. Can get basics with doing lots of joins and learning tidy data, SQL can learn with online tutorials
   4. Dashboards: Why learn? make it easy for other people?
5. Data Science Portfolio
   1. Idea is to bundle everything you can do together in one big thing 
   2. Best project is something you care about and is exclusive to you (aka your own research in open science framework) 
   3. This is something to build towards, not make in a weekend
