    1. First is to understand your audience (what do they value?) 
    2. You need to research the world you want to enter, entitled to think others will just get what you do
    3. Will give examples of this for data science later
    4. Resume will convey all of this quickly in one page (two if you have a lot of relevant experience) 
2. Rules of Thumb (Cover Letter, Resume) 
   1. Never write down something someone else could write down 
   2. Avoid langauge of "great oppertunity", especially women (Professor is In) 
   3. Never assume someone outside of your niche will understand your value structure (publications, conferences, how niche your research is)
