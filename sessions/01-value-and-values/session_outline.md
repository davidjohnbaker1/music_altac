## Session Outline

The purpose of the first session is to get participants to think about how they can leverage what they already know to help them learn about working outside academia. 
We will begin by talking about the "world" that we are currently in (acadamia) and how it differs from the "world" of industry.
For simplicity, the term industry here is just meant to be non-academic.

## Learning Objectives

After this session, participants should be able to:

* [ ] Describe how Concept Map organises information 
* [ ] Identify similarities and differences between values in academia/industry 

## Outline 

1. Introduce Rationale
    1. Most people will not as full time academics (might not even want that)
    2. It's hard to get advice from mentors since they work in academia 
    3. I have been lucky to work between worlds
    4. I want to share what I have learned thus far to help
2. Why me?  
    1. Background as Academic
    2. Background as "Industry"
    3. Goal is to share what I know to help others
3. The Two Worlds
    1. As grad students, live in academic world
    2. Familiar with what we have to do (course requirments)
    3. Also slowly learn "hidden curricula" (what is expected of us) 
    4. Could write this out in bullet points, but want to use chance to introduce concept map
    5. Academic Concept Map: Nouns in boxes, connect them with ideas, build up
    6. First show boxes of academia (publications, teaching, service, grants, pedigree) 
    7. Ask people to fill in ? 
    8. Now show map of industry
    9. What goes in here? (breakout session)
    10. Show my industry map 
4. Showing you "Get It"
    1. As in academic CV/reputation, need to show you "get it"
    2. In academia you show you can "do the job" with what we showed before, also that you get values
    3. In industry same idea, but terrain is different, they might be skeptical of you (especially phds) 
    4. Goal of next four sessions is advice on how to demonstrate that
