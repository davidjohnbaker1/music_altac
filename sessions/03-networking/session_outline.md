## Session Overview

## Learning Objectives

## Outline

1. Just like real life, all about who you know
    1. Networking is lame, making friends is good 
    2. Networking is a very, very long game
    3. Networking is not about just punching up (help everyone around you) 
    4. Networking is not zero sum game (if others win, you win). See therapist about scarcity mentality.
    5. People want to be the one to help others
2. Where to start?
    1. People you know: tell them what you want (could be I don't know) 
    2. Remember: make it easier for others
	DO: I am exploring options at this point after PhD. I want to hear about what life is like. 
	DONT: I don't really know what I want, like if academia doesn't work, might need real job (super insulting) 
    3. Don't expect your inner circle to be very helpful (they are academics, exception is MIR) 
    4. Ask to be pointed in direction, expect to be kicked around a bit (introductions for others)
    5. Be sincere. If you are "fake" people know and IMO detest it. Remember every PERSON you talk to is a person with wants and needs.
3. Talking to new people 
    1. Be clear about who you are, what you want ( template ) 
    2. Respect other's time
    3. Remember they want to grow their network as well (good people will not just punch up) 
    4. Don't expect anything right away, thank them for their time after the fact (email follow up, be sincere)
    5. Do only say things that you can say (return to this)
4. Cold Connections
    1. Connecting cold is also OK (not as easy) 
    2. Ideally message with what you have in common, what you want (make it easy for them, people want to help others) 
    3. You don't owe each other anyhing?
