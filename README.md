# Music AltAc

This repository contains all of the information needed for [David John Baker](http://github.com/davidjohnbaker1)s workshop on how to prepare for applying for work outside of academia while still a graduate student.
Materials in this workshop are geared towards graduate students in either music theory or music sciences, but could be applicable to most graduate students.

This repo is currently under development in preparation for a possible delivery at [SysMus2020]() in York, pending acceptance. 

The original abstract for this workshop can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HXHRucgK_h5rUuGephkWAX2yfW5nAPgehZJ4bC7_R4E/edit?usp=sharing)

There is also a [blog post here]() that covers some of the materials.

## To Do 

### Essential 

* [ ] Type Outline Each Sketch

* [ ] Transfer Outlines to Slides
* [ ] Create Resources Markdown 
* [ ] Create Each Activity Markdown 
* [ ] Create Long Checklist for Participants Markdown 
* [ ] Create Google Drive Exit Ticket 

### Non-Essential 

* [ ] Write complementary blog post for each session 
* [ ] Create bookdown for resources 
* [ ] Transfer Materials to bookdown 


## Participant Questions to Address

* Landing internship or marketing self for data science after training 
* Questions about post-doc in current recession ("economy" for big business is very different) 
* General interest about non-academic reserach options 
* Are my coding skills decent enough? 

## Persona

Is this workshop for you? 

* General Background:  Masters or PhD level graduates student in field of music. Assume  knowledge of academic job market post graduation as well as general culture  of academia. Assume that has not done much work outside of academia, and if has, probably in an area  where they don't want to return to (non-music, ex: teaching HS history)  

* Starting Point/Relevant Experience: Have done a few projects that require high level  thinking and organization, might have some technical skills either in terms of writing or programming or both. Some students will have knowledge of statistics and experimental design, but this is not required. Going to assume that students willing to learn new skills in order to become more employable.  

* Percieved Needs: Needs a long, actionable checklist of things they can work on while a busy graduate student in order to best increase their probability of landing secure employment after graduation. They want information that their academic advisor does not have by virtue of the fact that they do not work in industry full time. 

* Special Considerations: Students have very limited time to devote to this as time in grad school is not just all about career prep, espcially at PhD level. Students will also be slightly stressed because this workshop will be presented before conference where they share their own research. 

## Outline

The workshop will last approximently two hours and consist of five different sessions.
The sessions are listed below along with links to the slide decks.
